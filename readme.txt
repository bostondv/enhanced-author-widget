== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I style the Gravatar image? =

You can add and customize the following CSS within your theme's primary stylesheet/CSS file (normally style.css):

.author-grav img {
	/* These are just some example properties you can use */
	border: 2px solid #eeeeee;
	padding: 3px;
}

= Are subscribers included? =

No. Only contributors, authors, editors, and administrators (i.e. any user able to actually create posts).

= What's a Gravatar? =

A Gravatar is a Globally Recognized Avatar (i.e. your user picture/icon). You can upload one via <a href="http://gravatar.com">http://gravatar.com</a> (it will be attached to your e-mail address).

= Can I only display my Gravatar with the widget? =

Yes; simply leave your "Biographical Info" section (in your user profile) blank, and configure the widget to display your Gravatar.

= If an author doesn't have a Gravatar uploaded, and they configure the widget to display a Gravatar, which image is used? =

The default image is determined by the 'Default Avatar' setting found in your dashboard under Settings -> Discussion.

= I have a Gravatar configured, but it's not appearing. What's up? =

For the Gravatar to appear, you must have the 'Show Avatars' option under Settings -> Discussion set to 'Show Avatars'. Also, please check your 'Maximum Rating' setting and compare it with your own Gravatar's rating.

= What is the 'Custom Title'? =

By default the widget title will be the 'Display Name' of the author but you can override this by entering a value in this field.

= What is the 'Custom URL'? =

By default, if the author's profile has a website a link will be displayed. You can override this link to a custom url with this field.

= What is the 'Author'? =

By default the current post author will be displayed but you can override this by selecting an author from this drop down menu.
